# Your Development Environment

## Introduction

If being a software developer is being a craftsperson, then your computer (your development machine) is your workbench.

Over time, as you get better and better at your coding craft, you should build up preferences and wisdom about:

- tools you like and need
- how to manage those tools, their different versions, and how to use them (or stop using them!)
- how you like to organize or navigate to things
- shortcuts and display preferences

However, at Ada, **we require the use of *specific versions* of *specific tools*.**

## Today, We Will…

- Highlight the following topics:
    1. Our required operating system
    1. Some mandatory, foundational tools
    1. The expected text editor of our curriculum
    1. The recommended work directory for your Ada projects, exercises, notes, and materials
- Spend the majority of our time double-checking and verifying our tool installation documented in [Installfest](installfest.md).

## macOS Is Our Operating System

macOS is the required operating system for the Ada curriculum.

It isn't required to be a macOS wizard in the Ada curriculum, but it's recommended to get familiar enough with macOS that you can do the following things:

- Navigate the computer's file system using Finder and Terminal (do you know how to get to your home directory `~`?)
- Open and quit applications installed on your computer
- Recognize and execute keyboard shortcuts such as Copy (`⌘ + c`) and Paste (`⌘ + v`)
- Navigate text using your keyboard arrow keys, or other keyboard shortcuts
- Install an Internet Browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox, and use it to view web sites and access various search engines

For our full requirements and tips, use [Ada's How to macOS Guide](how-to-macOS.md).

## Installing Tools and Configuring Our Machines to Know How to Use Them

We need to equip our development machines with tools that allow developers to write Ruby code.

At a high-level, the tools we will install will transform our laptops from machines that consumers use for writing documents; Internet-browsing and meme-consuming; managing our bills, taxes, homes, chores, and online shopping; making movies and music; to now also saying "Hey! Our machine can read and execute (run) code that **we** write."

Please **follow [The Ada Installfest Guide](installfest.md) in order** and **completely** to make sure you're using only the correct tools for this curriculum.

We will learn about and install many additional tools throughout the Ada coursework, so get excited!

## Your Text Editor is Your Friend

If [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)) is our most important tool as a software developer, [the text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) must be the second most important.

Getting comfortable with using, navigating, and controlling our text editor will happen over time.

To help with getting to know our text editor, we have compiled a list of recommended configurations that the Ada curriculum will regularly reference. Please follow [Ada's guide to Getting to Know Your Text Editor](get-to-know-your-text-editor.md).

## We Have a Recommended Folder Organization Pattern

At Ada, over time, we will create hundreds of files and folders.

If you've never organized that many files and folders, and don't have an organizational preference, then we recommend following this folder structure:

### `~/Developer`

- A folder where you put all of your developer-y code stuff!
- Create this folder by running `$ mkdir ~/Developer`
- Navigate to this folder from any location in Terminal with `$ cd ~/Developer`, or by using relative path commands to change directories

### `~/Developer/projects`

- A folder where you put all of your Ada projects
- Create this folder by running `$ mkdir ~/Developer/projects`
- Navigate from anywhere with `$ cd ~/Developer/projects`

### `~/Developer/classroom`

- A folder where you put all of your notes, exercises, scratchwork, classroom activities, homework, etc.
- Create this folder by running `$ mkdir ~/Developer/classroom`
- Pick one of these two popular ways to organize your notes:
  - **By week** &mdash; You will create sub-folders nested here, such as `~/Developer/classroom/week-1`
  - **By topic** &mdash; Recommended topic folder names include `git`, `cs-fun`, `ruby`, `rails`, `js`, `react`, and so forth, so you will create sub-folders like `~/Developer/classroom/ruby`

Of course, feel free to not follow these recommendations if you have preferred ways of organizing files that will work better for you!

## Exceptions

The tools in this document were picked based on:

- Best practices and common practices in industry
- Availability and price
- Reliability

If you have a good reason to use an alternative tool, talk to the instructional team about it. All of the tools described here are tools that the instructors will use during class, and for which they can provide additional help and support.  Please use wisdom when considering alternative tools.
